ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @ValVelasquez

ðŸ”­ I'm new to GitHub and eager to learn more about the world of tech.

ðŸŒ± I'm deeply interested in all things related to machine learning (ML) and looking forward to exploring how machine learning models can be applied in various domains.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaborating on projects and willing to lend a hand wherever I can. I love the idea of learning by doing and contributing to meaningful work.

ðŸ’¼ Before diving into tech, I was a business owner. My venture involved growing and exporting fried plantains to the US. This experience taught me a lot about growth, resilience, and the value of good teamwork.

ðŸ’¬ If you're looking for assistance on a project, have questions about transitioning to tech from a different field, or just want to chat about innovative tech, feel free to reach out to me!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can send me a message right here on GitHub.

âš¡ Fun fact: I've seen firsthand how tech can revolutionize industries, and I believe there's a lot of untapped potential in combining traditional business wisdom with cutting-edge tech.
